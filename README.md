To work on Smart ride project:

1. create a folder in your local computer
2. clone/ pull the code from this repository
3. create a checkout branch before making any changes, i.e "git chekout -b <New_branch_name> <main_branch>
4. in our case the main branch is called master
5. after changes are made, create a pull request to merge with the master branch, don't do upstream all the way.
