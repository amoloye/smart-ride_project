To work on the Smart Ride project:

1. create a folder on your local computer
2. clone/ pull/ fetch the code from this repository as it applies to it (remember to fetch every time before making changes to update your local code base.
3. create a checkout branch before making any changes, i.e "git checkout -b <New_branch_name> <main_branch>
4. in our case the main branch is called master
5. after changes are made, create a pull request to merge with the master branch, don't do it upstream all the way.
